First, you need to have the Ionic CLI installed globally. If you haven't done so already:
npm install -g @ionic/cli
For installing capacitor
ionic integrations enable capacitor
Now, add platforms (e.g., Android or iOS) depending on which native platform you are targeting.
For Android:
ionic capacitor add android
For iOS:
ionic capacitor add ios

You can run the development server:
ionic serve
This will start a local web server for web development, where you can test the UI in the browser. Keep in mind that Capacitor features (e.g., native plugins) wonâ€™t work in the browser but will work on actual devices.
When you are ready to build and test on an actual device (Android or iOS), first build the web assets:
ionic build
Then copy the web assets to the native platforms using:
npx cap copy
To open and run the app in Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS):
For Android:
npx cap open android
For iOS:
npx cap open ios

For Installing icons
npm install ionicons
